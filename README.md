      Multiple Linear Regression in C.
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      The project uses structures in C to create a linear model.The variable of the type <b>struct MLR</b> stores the weights corresponding to the model. The get model function is created which returns the pointer to a variable model by initializing all weights to zer0. The data is read with the help of reading a comma seperated value(<b>csv</b>) file. I created two functions to count the number of data points and the number of features in the csv. You have to create two double type double pointers and allocate them memory as per needed. The bias is accommodated by keeping an extra weight in the model matrix of weights.
